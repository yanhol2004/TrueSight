### üì∞ **Fact-Checking Headlines with Google Fact Check API**
TrueSight integrates with the **Google Fact Check API** to analyze and validate news headlines. With just a click, you can:
- **Verify the credibility** of news articles.
- Get claims reviewed by trusted fact-checking organizations.
- **View ratings** for each claim, such as "True," "False," or "Labeled Satire."
- **Access sources** directly from the tool for deeper analysis.

> Example: A headline like *"Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump for president"* will be verified against trusted sources, revealing it as "Labeled Satire" and providing a direct link to the fact-checking website.
